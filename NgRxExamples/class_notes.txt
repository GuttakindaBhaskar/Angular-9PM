1) Basic Architecture

2) NgRx without RxJS   ( without Backend )

3) NgRx with RxJS       (with Backend)

    => MongoDB

    => Node Server

    => RxJS   (Observable)

    => NgRx   (State)

Store
-----
    - Store the main component of NgRx Package.
    - Store Accomidates Reducer, initialState and State.

Reducer
-------

    - Business Logic Called as Reducer.
    - Reducer output called as State.

State
-----

    - Final Application Result (Reducer Output) called as State.

initialState
------------

    - Initial Input of the Application called as initialState.

dispatch
--------
    - sending the request from client application store called as dispatch


Action
------
    - client application requirement technically called as Action.

    Ex.
        WITHDRAW
        DEPOSIT
        MINISTATEMENT
        ----
        ----
        ----

payload:
--------
    - sending the dispatch from client to store with "data" technically called as payload.

    Ex.
            1000
            10000

subscribe
---------
    - Receiving (State) from store to client application.


Basic Example on NgRx Package
-----------------------------

Step 1.
    create the angular application

    > ng new ngRxDemo1

Step 2.
    switch to angular application

    > cd ngRxDemo1


Step 3.
    download the modules

    => @ngrx/core

    => @ngrx/store

    => @ngrx/action


    > yarn add @ngrx/core   @ngrx/store   @ngrx/action  bootstrap  --save
